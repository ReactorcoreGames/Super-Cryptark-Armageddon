## About
Super Cryptark Armageddon is a mod for Cryptark, a PC game made by Alientrap Games.

Cryptark itself is about mechs, nukes, derelict spacehulks, blowing shit up using 4 switchable guns at once, smashing hundreds of alien skeleton zombie cyborgs and just being a goddamn badass. Get the game here:

This mod shifts the focus of the game less about tight frugal survival and more towards overkill excess, empowerment, maximum firepower and abundance - for the player's favor.

## Install
1. Go to the game's Cryptark/Content/GameObjects folder and DELETE the 'Weapons', 'Items' and 'Projectiles' folders within it.
2. Copy/move the mod's 'Content' folder into your Cryptark game folder. Overwrite everything.

Thats all. Play the game - either campaign, rogue mode, excavation - the changes will be apparent as you play the game. You will encounter new weapons/items and see the new ships filled with crazy new enemies. 

My favorite way to play is Rogue mode, you start with a good loadout and you can swap items you find in the pods scattered around the ship, adapting to the situation as you go.

NOTE: After installing the mod, the game may crash ONCE and only once as it resets itself due to detecting and loading all the new content and changes, discarding the old settings in the process. This is normal and only happens once. Its not elegant, but after this first-time crash, the game will work flawlessly from start to finish, provided the above action list to prevent crashes is respected.

If you wish to remove the mod, just reinstall the game. Make a copy/backup of your profile save file in the Content/SavedGames folder before doing this - mostly to preserve lore unlocks and access to the two game modes.

## Mod Philosophy
The intention of this mod is to provide a true power fantasy, not to make the game harder, even if it is a bit crazier now.

I wanted to have more ammo and less cost, so that I can shoot my guns without counting every bullet. I also wanted all weapons and items to be useful, worth their cost and powerful/effective. This mod provides all that.

While new enemy ships *are* more crowded, challenging and bigger, the player in this mod is also 50x more powerful than in base game, able to truly annihilate entire armies on their own now.

I wanted a game that I could boot up, give me randomized experience and let me blow stuff up for 30-60 minutes with some surprises created by procedural generation, so I can refresh and go continue working on other stuff.

Load up on heavy weapons, spare no expense, hold down the trigger and kick ass, pilot. The ARMAGEDDON is ON!

### OTHER:
- Low Detail mode enabled by default, you can now see everything fully.
- If like not being able to see anything because the default game is way too dark, just turn off Low Detail mode in the options.
- Various hazards, effects and elements were tweaked, such as EMP, beams, projectiles, vortexes and mines.
- Player loadouts were increased with the ammo overhaul.
- Player pioneer suit health default and max values have been changed.
- Player abilities were buffed (Slomo, Cloak)
- Voice Audio was disabled (they got annoying and repetitive after replaying the game for the 8th time). Can be re-enabled in the Config-33.cfg.
- Weapon stats enabled when selecting weapons.
- Don't play the finale mission (cryptark excavation). Its not canon. Government dudes are best bros and I'd never let them down.
(It works, I just don't agree with its premise and ending.)
